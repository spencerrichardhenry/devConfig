# MacOS customization

## System Settings
**System Settings -> search "Modifier" -> Keyboard Shortcuts**
- **Modifier Keys:** Change ctrl to cmd and vica versa. Be sure to have **moonlander mk 1** selected when doing this (though you probably want al keyboards swapped) 
- **Screenshots:** Change `Copy picture of selected area to the clipboard` to `Vyper + S`

**System Settings -> search "period" -> Keyboard -> Spelling:** 
- Turn off `add period w double space. 
- Turn off auto capitalize and auto correct. 
- Turn off smart quotes (smart quotes busts some things when i.e. copy pasting into terminal.

**System Settings -> Trackpad:** 
- Tracking speed to 1 above middle (4 lines showing to right)
- tap to click enabled

## Spectacle Settings
Spectacle is my preferred window mgmt software. Basically, Vyper+arrows for left/right snap, and up/down for bigger/smaller. Be sure to enable auto-start on login.
